# SavingVan
Keeps some data around the saving van

## What is it about?

The SavingVan is a collaborative project to have a van available to rescue valuable resources that would otherwise go to waste or to work with very low cost material that others want to get rid off.

## How is it financed?

We hope to be able to publish all financing here. Initial funding is done privately but the goal is to be able to finance the project completely by donations or rescueing for example beverages that give a deposit

## The van

It is a Ford Transit, build in november 1987. It is pretty big, pretty hungry on petrol and not very powerful :-)
